# Elevator

This is an implementation of an elevator which the current floor number and the destination floor number are displayed via a seven-segment display.
The user can add floor number with an external button and decrease it with another external button and confirm the destination with the third external button.
Also, if a failure occurs, the user can push an external button then an alarm (buzzer) allerts and the LEDs on the board will be turned on and off.
This elevator has an admin mode in which maximum number of floors and waiting time can be set, and the elevator's performance can be tested with the desired inputs.
